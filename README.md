## Overview

**Hermes Mobile** is the native Android client for [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com). It connects to your Hermes gateway (REST API and WebSocket TUI Gateway), giving you pocket control over your AI assistant. Plain HTTP/WS connections are intended for trusted networks only; authentication does not encrypt the transport.

## Support the project

If Hermes Mobile is useful to you, consider supporting its development on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/m_5_7).

## Quick Start

1. Install Hermes Mobile from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.m57.hermescontrol/) or download the APK from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Hy4ri/hermes-mobile/releases/latest).
2. Start your Hermes dashboard on a host reachable from your phone.
3. Follow [Authentication](#authentication) below to connect. Use a trusted network for plain HTTP/WS connections.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 21+** (required for Kotlin compilation and the Gradle toolchain)
- An **Android SDK** matching the compile SDK in [`app/build.gradle.kts`](app/build.gradle.kts), available through Android Studio or the **Nix** development environment. Set `ANDROID_HOME` or configure `sdk.dir` in your local `local.properties`.

### Build & Deploy

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hy4ri/hermes-mobile.git
   cd hermes-mobile
   ```
2. **Build the debug APK:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
3. **Install on your emulator/device:**
   ```bash
   adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

_Note: For release builds, ensure keystore environment variables (`KEYSTORE_PATH`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`) are configured, or let the GitHub Actions release workflow handle it on tag push (`v*`)._

### Nix emulator

The Nix development shell enables physical keyboard input in an existing
`hermes_dev` AVD configuration. It respects `ANDROID_AVD_HOME` and
`ANDROID_USER_HOME`, defaulting to `~/.android/avd`.

Close any running emulator, then cold boot once to apply the setting:

```bash
nix develop --command emulator -avd hermes_dev -no-snapshot-load
```

Subsequent launches can omit `-no-snapshot-load`. Create the `hermes_dev` AVD
first if it does not exist; the shell does not create one.

---

## Authentication

Once the app is installed, you need to point it at your Hermes gateway. The app auto-detects which auth mode the dashboard is using — just fill in the fields it shows.

### 1. Start the dashboard

On your host machine, start the dashboard:

```bash
hermes dashboard                          # loopback (127.0.0.1:9119) — no auth needed
hermes dashboard --host 0.0.0.0           # LAN — requires auth
```

For LAN access, configure credentials in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
dashboard:
  basic_auth:
    username: admin # pick your own
    password: hermes # pick your own
```

### 2. Connect the app

Tap **Sign in** on the landing screen and enter the dashboard host and port. The app probes the dashboard and reveals the fields you need:

| Auth mode      | When                                 | What you fill                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token only** | Dashboard on same machine (loopback) | **Token** — grab from `~/.hermes/dashboard-token.txt` or `~/.hermes/.env` (`HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN`). The app can also auto-extract it from the dashboard page |
| **Basic auth** | Dashboard on LAN with password gate  | **Username** + **Password** (default `admin` / `hermes`). The app logs in, gets a session cookie, and mints a WebSocket ticket automatically                           |

Use HTTPS for remote connections. Use HTTP only on a trusted local network.

### HTTPS client certificates (mTLS)

When an HTTPS server requests a client certificate during its TLS handshake,
Android's system certificate picker opens while the app is in the foreground.
Install your client certificate using Android's settings first. The app remembers
only the selected alias; Android keeps and uses the private key.

The selection applies to the HTTPS hostname and port, across paths and profiles
at that address. A server that does not request a client certificate works without
one, even when a selection is remembered. Hermes login is still required, and
server certificate and hostname verification remain enabled.

The login form and **Settings → Connection → Edit** provide certificate status,
**Select / reselect certificate**, and **Clear selection**. These actions take effect
immediately, independently of saving the profile. Clear unbinds the alias and closes
connections for that address; it does not delete the system certificate. The next
TLS handshake may request a new selection. Reselecting closes existing connections
so REST, WebSocket, images, attachments, and media use the new selection. An in-flight
request or media playback may fail when its connection closes; retry it if needed.

Cancellation suppresses further automatic prompts for that address until you
explicitly select again, clear the selection, or restart the app. A background
request can use an existing authorized certificate but cannot open the picker:
bring the app forward and retry. The handshake waits at most 90 seconds for a
selection; dismiss an expired picker and use **Select / reselect certificate** again.
Certificate settings do not import private CAs or change Android's server trust policy.

### Cloudflare Access and custom headers

1. Enter your dashboard's HTTPS URL on the login screen.
2. Tap **Custom headers**, then **Add Cloudflare headers**.
3. Enter your service token's `CF-Access-Client-Id` and `CF-Access-Client-Secret` values.
4. Tap **Save**. The app probes the dashboard again, then shows the Hermes login fields.

Your [Cloudflare Access policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/)
must accept the service token. These headers authenticate with Cloudflare; you still
need to complete Hermes authentication.

You can add other custom header names and values in the same editor. To edit or
remove saved headers, open **Custom headers** from login or the saved connection's
edit dialog in Settings. Values are masked and stored in encrypted preferences.
Saving an empty list removes the headers for that URL.

Headers are shared by profiles with the same server URL. They apply to probes,
login, API and media requests, and WebSocket handshakes. Each URL's scheme, host,
port, and path prefix limit where its headers are sent. Redirects outside that
scope do not receive the credentials; WebSocket redirects are not followed.
The app manages `Authorization`, `Cookie`, and transport headers itself.

### Connection profiles

Have multiple gateways? Switch between them in **Settings → Connection profiles**. Each profile stores its own host, port, and token — just tap to swap.
